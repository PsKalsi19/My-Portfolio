          <p>
            The most basic way of explaining PWA is to say it's a
            <strong>website turned application</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may be thinking about starting a business and working on a
            groundbreaking project, but you're unsure whether to create a website or
            a native app. If you're debating the same issue, take a look at this.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the one hand, <strong>web applications</strong> enable users to share
            information easily via web links; using them may only require user
            registration. Not to mention that if it is responsive, all types of
            devices can access it.
          </p>
          <p>
            While native applications require installation, which uses up memory on
            the device, they load more quickly, are simpler to use, and make better
            use of the hardware in the system once they are in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            While creating both for the same application is certainly feasible,
            doing so would only increase the codebase, effort, and required working
            hours, which would result in a loss of financial resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do, however, live in a wonderful world where it is possible to have
            the best of both worlds with a <strong>Progressive Web App</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            PWA is built on the web while providing native app capabilities such as
            it being <span class="blog-highlight">installable</span> on your device, and providing
            <span class="blog-highlight">faster</span> access to pages after the first load. Though it is
            not yet fully capable of using the system's hardware, it most of the
            time gets the Job done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine if you are working in a company that requires you to access some
            portal make some changes maybe do some data entry operations. PWA can
            allow you to make these changes even if you do not have the network.
            Using
            <a target="_blank" class="link blog-link"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API"
              >Service Worker API</a
            >, it can later sync that data with the server whenever the network
            would be available. It can also take advantage of
            <a target="_blank" class="link blog-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API"
              >IndexedDB API</a
            >, to store data in browser database storage. Furthermore, it consumes
            very little system storage while still competing with the native App.
            PWA enables so many other features that it no longer appears necessary
            to create a Native App for most use cases. PWA simplifies and reduces
            the cost of managing your applications.
          </p>
          <p><strong>So does that mean PWA is the answer to everything</strong></p>
          <p>
            Well, no, for a Javascript developer like me, it appears to be a
            paradise that I won't have to learn ten new things to code for a native
            app, but there are a few places where PWA simply cannot work its magic
            yet.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>PWA cannot send push notifications to iOS devices.</li>
            <li>
              PWA does not support Bluetooth and cannot work with a fingerprint
              scanner or proximity scanner.
            </li>
            <li>Battery usage is not completely optimized.</li>
          </ul>
